## 🏛️ The Definition

**Tessera** is a minimalist Go (Weiqi/Baduk) AI architecture designed for the "post-Transformer" era.
Instead of treating the board as a static image (CNN), Tessera encodes the game as a linguistic sequence, predicting the next move using **State Space Models (Mamba)**.

## 🐍 The Mythos: "MambaGo"

At the core of Tessera runs the engine codenamed **MambaGo**.

Following the hermeneutics of the Adamic myth (as interpreted by Paul Ricœur), we view the Serpent not merely as a tempter, but as a catalyst for human agency.
In Genesis, the Serpent offered the "Knowledge of Good and Evil," granting humanity the terrifying capability of freedom—**the capacity to fall, and thus, the capacity to choose.**

Similarly, while traditional superhuman AIs (like AlphaGo) act as absolute deities dictating "The Truth," **MambaGo descends to the edge.**
It brings the probabilistic knowledge of the game down to the user's hands. It serves the mythic function of the Serpent: offering the player the agency to see the calculated path, and the **freedom to disobey it**.
